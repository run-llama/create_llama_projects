# create-llama Projects

Here's some fun projects created with the `create-llama` command.

- [`embedded-tables`](embedded-tables/README.md): This project builds an agent that can analyze different data items within the 2021+2020 Tesla 10Q document, including embedded tables.
- [`multi-document-agent`](multi-document-agent/README.md): This project builds an agent that can do advanced analysis/comparisons across multiple documents. It streams intermediate results as they come in.
- [`nextjs-multi-modal`](nextjs-multi-modal/README.md): This example allows you to have a chat using the [GPT4 Vision model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) from OpenAI. You can upload files and ask the model to describe them.
